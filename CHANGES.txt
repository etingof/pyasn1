Revision 0.0.7a
---------------

- Large tags (>31) now supported by codecs.
- Fix to encoder to properly handle explicitly tagged untagged items.
- All possible value lengths (up to 256^126) now supported by encoders.

Revision 0.0.6a
---------------

- Make use of setuptools.
- Constraints derivation verification (isSuperTypeOf()/isSubTypeOf()) fixed.
- Fix to constraints comparation logic -- can't cmp() hash values as it
  may cause false positives due to hash conflicts.

Revision 0.0.5a
---------------

- Integer BER codec reworked fixing negative values encoding bug.
- clone() and subtype() methods of Constructed ASN.1 classes now 
  accept optional cloneValueFlag flag which controls original value
  inheritance. The default is *not* to inherit original value for 
  performance reasons (this may affect backward compatibility).
  Performance penalty may be huge on deeply nested Constructed objects
  re-creation.
- Base ASN.1 types (pyasn1.type.univ.*) do not have default values
  anymore. They remain uninitialized acting as ASN.1 types. In 
  this model, initialized ASN.1 types represent either types with
  default value installed or a type instance.
- Decoders' prototypes are now class instances rather than classes.
  This is to simplify initial value installation to decoder's
  prototype value.
- Bugfix to BitString BER decoder (trailing bits not regarded).
- Bugfix to Constraints use as mapping keys.
- Bugfix to Integer & BitString clone() methods
- Bugix to the way to distinguish Set from SetOf at CER/DER SetOfEncoder
- Adjustments to make it running on Python 1.5.
- In tests, substrate constants converted from hex escaped literals into
  octals to overcome indefinite hex width issue occuring in young Python.
- Minor performance optimization of TagSet.isSuperTagSetOf() method
- examples/sshkey.py added
